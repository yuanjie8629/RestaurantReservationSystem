# RestaurantReservationSystem

## Overview
<p>A Teppanyaki Japanese restaurant serves supreme quality meal for their guests. Guests have a front row seat on how Master chef prepares their dishes. Their authentic setting places guests in a traditional Japanese style establishment and fits perfectly to its cuisine and feel.</p>
<p>Due to popular demand and limited seating availability, guests have to reserve seats at least 3 days in advance for enjoying meal at their restaurant. The restaurant only serves 4 sessions (11:00am – 12:30pm, 12:30pm – 2:00pm, 5:00pm – 6:30pm and 6:30pm – 8:00pm) each day and each session only serves 8 guests.</p>
<p>Therefore, this system is developed to help in processing the reservation records. Additionally, this system applies structured programming approach.</p>
<p>The functions of the system are as follows:</p>

1. **List** <br> Display the reservation records. Each display should contain an appropriate heading and column captions.<br><br>
2. **Search for Availability** <br> Search for the availability in the list using the date, time and number of guests.<br><br>
3. **Update Reservation Record** <br> Ask user for date, time and number of guests. Then search for availability in the list using the input data.<br><br>
4. **Exit** <br> Stop the program. The program will write the updated data in the list to the file.<br><br>
5. **Advanced Search** <br> Search for guest record(s) in the list using the name or phone number.<br><br>
